* COMMENT ideas for presentation
- motivation
  - tree growth as a problem
    - I needed to predict growth through time for ecosystem service modeling
  - The UTD
    - discuss the data
      - cities, species, map
  - existing framework as unsatisfactory
    - show the silly predictions made
      - maple, add vertical lines for apps max and apps min.
- Bayesian Nonlinear Multilevel Modeling
  - the solution
- The model
  - explain the model, use figures to make the parameters more understandable.
    - show how changing the parameter from "low" to "high" changes the curve
  - the betas as functions of species and genus and city
  - beta 3 as a function of climate as well.
  - talk about prior distributions
- Fitting Model in Stan via brms
  - show the full model written out. and show the brms syntax for comparison.
  - show HMC sampling video. http://chi-feng.github.io/mcmc-demo/
    - I should probably just take a video of this.
