* COMMENT Objective
Concept: Application of bayesian multilevel modelling approach using
Stan via the R package brms.
Motivation: To create better allometric equations for urban trees.
* COMMENT Caveat
I am not an expert on this, but I think I have a contribution to
make.  I'm using a dataset I did not work to collect and it may have
idiosyncrasies that I may not understand.  I also don't fully understand
the modelling approach used to create the equations, namely the
weighting.

* COMMENT Why needed
Whoops.  They do have equations by tree type:
Tree types: BDL = broadleaf deciduous large, BDM = broadleaf deciduous
medium, BDS = broadleaf deciduous small, BEL = broadleaf evergreen
large, BEM = broadleaf evergreen medium, BES = broadleaf evergreen
small, CEL = conifer evergreen large, CEM = conifer evergreen medium,
CES = conifer evergreen small, PEL = palm evergreen large, PEM = palm
evergreen medium, PES= palm evergreen small.

The urban tree allometry dataset is an incredibly valuable resource
for making better predictions about tree growth in urban environments,
and it is essential for accurate ecosystem service evaluation.
However, there are a number of limitations with the current set of
equations that multilevel modelling can address.

Limitations:
1) Limited number of species in each region.  There are only equations
   for the ten most common urban tree species in each region.  If a
   user wants an equation for a different species, they either need to
   use an equation for that species from a different region, or select
   the equation from the species they think is most similar.

2) Hard boundaries of regions.  There are separate allometric
   equations for 16 distinct climatic regions in the US.  However
   climate varies continuously across space.  Users of the equations
   have to pick which region they are closest to, or consider
   averaging two equations, but the weighting could be difficult to
   determine.  Climatic differences have been discretized/binned into
   relatively few groups, when it could be more continuous.

3) Some of the existing equations are based on smaller sample sizes
   than reported.  For example, dbh as a function of age for...  only
   has two observations and so the best fitting equation is a straight
   line, but we know that isn't right.

4) used the best fitting model of several forms based on AIC (i
   think).  This could potentially lead to overfitting, and depending
   on the model form selected, makes extrapolation very tenuous.

Solution: Allow for information to be shared across species and across
regions when fitting models.  Include climate variables as predictors
in the model so that the allometric equations vary continuously across
space.

A multilevel model would allow for the partial pooling of information
across species and across cities, so that in the cases where we have
little or even no data, we can still make reasonable predictions.  If
we want to make predictions about red maple in our city where we have
no observations, a multilevel model would allow us to take the red
maple equation from another city and adjust it to fit the climate of
our city.

Improvements:
1) Climate based rather than regions based.  Continuous rather than
   discrete, gradient rather than hard boundaries.
2) Rather than set Apps min and Apps Max, we can relax these hard
   boundaries, but include information about how uncertainty
   increases.  Appsmin and Appsmax significantly truncates predictive
   envelope.
3) Can use an equation form that makes sense to extrapolate with (this
   is probably more realistic and worth the decrease in equation form flexibility).
4) Species can be nested within Genus, Genus within broader type
   (conifer/broadleaf/palm etc).


1) One equation for 10 species in each region.  What about species not
   on the list?  What if I'm interested in the equation for red maple
   in the southeast, but the only equation comes from the northeast
   region?  How should I adjust the equation?
2) What if my location is on the border of two regions?  How should I
   average the equations from each region, espcially if they are of
   two different forms (e.g. cubic and log-log)?
   1) this could allow for easy integration of new cities too, because
      right now equations for each region just come from 1 or 2 cities.


1) Currently urban tree allometric equations are built separately for
   each species and for each region.  So there is a separate equation
   for red maple in the northeast and a separate equation for red
   maple in the midwest. These are hard differences when such hard
   divisions don't exist.  Better models for red maple could probably
   be made if the different regions could be pooled to the extent that
   their climates are similar.
2)


For practicioners who wish to use

what was the metric used to select from models?  was it r^2?  they
used AIC
shouldn't we select the model form based on expert knowledge about
universal tree growth patterns, rather than a small sample of
observations?  We'd expect to occasionally find with small samples
that a cubic relationship best fits the data.  But this relationship
suffers from lack of basis in what we know about how trees grow and
may give grossly inaccurate predictions if considered outside the
range of the data.

note on pg 130: for biomass equations:
"Zianis et al. (2005) found that more than two-thirds of the
equations they examined were functions of just DBH, and more than 75%
of the studies that reported a sample size had less than 50
trees. The use of just DBH assumes that the relationship between DBH
and height is static, which is often not the case, as noted above."

"The application to other populations of simple model forms fitted to
small datasets can produce large prediction errors (e.g. Wang et al.,
2002a). In addition, development of universal (Pilli et al., 2006) and
generalized (Muukkonen, 2007) static equations ignores significant
species variability and complex relationships, particularly when the
goal is to estimate regional and national biomass (Zianis and
Mancuccini, 2004)."

* Introduction

Multilevel models have been used for decades in tree growth equations
(Lappi and Bailey 1988).  Indeed the test dataset, "orange", in the
statistical programming language, R, is used to demonstrate the
fitting of nonlinear multilevel (mixed effects) models cite:r_lang
[[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/Orange.html][orange]].  Multilevel modeling is an attractive approach because it
provides a coherent framework to account for the many levels of
observation or of groupings in data and to pool information across
groups.  This paper has two main contributions.  First, we demonstrate
the use of Stan via the "brms" package in R to fit bayesian nonlinear
multilevel models to predict tree diameter growth from age
cite:carpenter_e_2017,buerkner_2017.  Second, we apply the method to
the Urban Tree Database cite:utd_2016,mcpherson_e_2016.  This dataset
is the result an over a decade long effort to collect age and size
data on thousands of trees in 17 cities across the US.  Multilevel
modeling has the potential to extract more information from the data
and improve predictions compared to the existing modeling approach.
Improving predictions of tree size from tree age will improve our
ability to predict the important ecosystem services these trees
provide urban dwellers.

Stan is a probabilistic programming language for bayesian inference
cite:carpenter_e_2017.  It uses No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, to effectively draw samples from the
specified log posterior density.  Here, we access Stan via the R
package brms cite:buerkner_2017. brms allows the user to specify the
likelihood and priors in syntax similar to the R package lme4 commonly
used for frequentist? multilevel (mixed effects) models.  This makes
harnessing the power of Stan much simpler and concise because it
doesn't require the user to know how to write efficient Stan code and
can convert a few lines of R code into many lines of Stan. brms is not
as flexible as stan, but still can be used to fit many types of models
including nonlinear multilevel regression models, such as ours here.
Some of the key advantages of fitting a model in Stan via brms include
relatively simple syntax and efficient posterior sampling for
multilevel non-linear models.  The bayesian approach gives better
estimates of parameter uncertainty and provides a formal way to
include prior information.

The existing approach to modeling the diameter growth of trees in the
urban tree database (UTD) was to fit a separate model for each tree
species in each city and test several model forms with different
weights and then select the model with the lowest Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC).  This approach has several limitations, many
highlighted in the report.  First, while the model form selected
provided the lowest AIC, many of the estimates are not biologically
realistic (for example they begin to increase sharply at old ages,
cubic fits, or decrease at old ages, quadratic fits).  Therefore, the
researchers discouraged applying the models beyond the range of the
data, or sometimes even within the range of data if the estimates were
unrealistic.  These unrealistic estimates and the inability to
extrapolate severely limits managers' ability to predict growth over
meaningful time scales (a century rather than a few decades).  A
second limitations is that some models predict negative diameters, an
impossibility.  Third, models are only provided for the cities and the
species sampled.  If a manager wants to predict the diameter growth of
a tree species in an unsampled city, the researchers recommend using
the model from the reference city in the same climate region.  However
many of the reference cities are on the border of climate regions and
there is known large variability in growth within regions (see figure
XX in utd report which is from McPherson.... comparing Cheyenne to Ft
Collins).  Furthermore, if a manager wants to predict growth for an
unsampled species or a species that was sampled in a different city it
is not obvious which equation/model to use and the additional
uncertainty that this introduces is not quantified.

Our approach addresses the above limitations.  First, we use a weibull
curve, commonly used in foresty growth equations and biologically
realistic, which makes extrapolation to ages outside the data range
less fraught.  Second, using this sigmoidal curve and modeling
diameter with a gamma distribution ensures our estimates of diameter
are positive.  Third, by modeling the weibull curve parameters as
functions of species, city, and climate, we are able to borrow
information across cities and across species to provide predictions an
associated uncertainty of diameter growth even in even in cities or
species with very little or no data.

Multilevel modeling in non-urban forestry ....  other work.  how is
this different?  Well the urban part, management practices like
topping, pollarding, pruning, drastically alter growth and tree
dimensions.  Others have discussed the difference between forest and
urban/open grown trees a fair bit.  The Stan and brms part, these
software are new.  What about the modeling approach?  I don't think
many past effects have so many levels, or have things vary by climate.
The geographic extent of these urban models is very large.  There are
a number of papers that have done multilevel modeling for tree growth
that I should mention.

maybe the framewaork should be broader, just growth equations for all
trees with urban tree as a case study/example of application.


There are two story lines.
1) use of newerish statistical package to fit a pretty complex model
2) that growth equations for urban trees are newish, can be improved,
   and are important because they are fundamental to predicting
   ecosystem services.


Big problem   - urban ecosystem services depends on trees. predicting
depends on growth
narrower within - urban trees growth differently, there had been a
lack of data.
yet narrower
summary of approach and results

1) theoretically sound model form (through use of weibull)
2) expansion of predictive envelope/potential (through use of
   multilevel modeling).

Objective is to show how multilevel models can be used to predict tree
growth
1) Information about species functional groups and phylogeny to
   predict growth for unobserved species
2) Information about
3) Information about climate to predict growth in unobserved cities
4)


Urban trees have important ecological effects in cities that can
affect human wellbeing.  Forecasting ecosystem service provision by
trees requires a model of tree growth, since most services are
directly related to tree size (e.g. carbon storage in biomass, air
filtration by leaf area).  Until recently urban tree growth equations
have been rare because of lacking data.  In 2016 the US Forest Service
published the "Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations", a
valuable dataset of the most common tree species in a dozen cities
across the US.  In addition to allometric equations, they also provide
growth equations.

While they are great step forward and an incredible resource, their
growth equations have limitations.  First, their method of model
selection simply chose the curve with the lowest AIC.  This meant that
any amount of extrapolation was highly suspect.  In the extreme case
where a species only had two observations in a city, the only possible
fit was a line. Second, they only fit equations for the most common
species in each of the cities they sampled.  It is not clear how to
modify an equation to fit a unobserved species or a unobserved city.
If red maple was not a species sampled in my city, should I use the
red maple equation from a climaticly dissimilar city?  Or should I use
the equation from the species most similar to red maple from my city?
What if I want to make a prediction about an unobserved species in an
unobserved city?

We remove these limitations by fitting a multilevel weibull model to
the data.  The weibull curve has a long history of use in forestry and
captures asymtotic growth well.  While it may not provide the best fit
to every dataset, it realistically models growth given what we know
about biological constraints, is flexible, and is less unreasonable to
extrapolate from.  The multilevel model allows information to be
shared across species and across cities, and, when combined with
species' phylogenetic data and cities' climate data, allows for
predictions at combinations of cities and species with little or no
individual level data, provided we know genus/functional group of the
species and the climate of the city.

Urban Tree Database and Allometric Equations
E. Gregory McPherson, Natalie S. van Doorn, and Paula J. Peper

The economic, social, and ecological benefits of trees are directly
related to their size, as indicated by leaf area, crown volume, and
bio- mass (Scott et al. 1998, Stoffberg et al. 2010, Xiao et
al. 2000a). Growth equa- tions underpin the calculations produced by
many computer models used in urban forestry, such as i-Tree, National
Tree Benefit Calculator, OpenTreeMap, and ecoSmart Landscapes
(fig. 1).

Quotes from the utd publication:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The development of allometric equations for urban open-grown trees has
been sporadic. Fleming (1988) measured trees in New Jersey having full
healthy crowns to develop linear relationships between d.b.h., height,
crown spread, and age. Frelich (1992) measured only healthy trees (12 species, 221
trees total) growing in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, to
predict linear size relation- ships. Nowak (1994b) developed an
allometric equation for leaf area based on data from park trees in
Chicago. Tree dimensions and leaf area were predicted for the most
abundant street tree species in Modesto and Santa Monica, Califor- nia
(Peper et al. 2001a, 2001b). In New Haven, Connecticut, Troxel et
al. (2013) developed allometric equations for predicting d.b.h. from
age and height, crown diameter, and crown volume from d.b.h. for early
growth (15 years) of 10 street tree species. Outside of North America,
growth equations have been developed for street-side Tilia species in
Copenhagen, Denmark (Larsen and Kristoffersen 2002), and T. cordata
Mill., Fraxinus excelsior L. and Aesculus hippocastanum L. in Warsaw,
Poland (Lukaszkiewicz and Kosmala 2008, Lukaszkiewicz et
al. 2005). Predictive models were developed from allometric data for
five street tree species in northeastern Italy by Semenzato et
al. (2011). Stoffberg et al. (2008) used allometric relationships
between age and d.b.h., height, and crown diameter to estimate
dimensions at 10, 15, and 30 years after planting for three street
tree species in Tshwane, South Africa. The allometric equations from
all these studies reflect the effects of local site conditions,
management practices, and growing season on growth, limiting
application outside their region of origin (fig. 5).

This report presents the third, most recent and most complete sets of

developed using more sophisticated statistical methods than
before. For example, in the first studies, logarithmic regression and
exponential models predominantly provided the best fits to measured
data (Peper et al. 2001a, 2001b). In these equations, the best model
fits ranged from polynomials (from simple linear to quartic) to
logarithmic and exponential models (Peper et al. 2014). The newest

* Methods
** Data

The urban tree database (UTD) consists of measurements on 14487 trees of 170
species in 17 cities.  However, largely because of the difficulty is measuring
tree age, there are only 12687 trees with complete age and diameter
data (161 species, 17 cities, 309 species by city combinations [[fig:City_Species_Ntrees]]).

Some species were measured in multiple cities, but not most.  The number of
trees of each city by species combination sampled ranged from 1
(both Liquidambar styraciflu and Prunus serrulata in Queens, NY) to 79
(Quercus laurifolia in Charleston, SC).  The median number of trees in
each species-city combination was 37.

Age is defined in this dataset as time since planting, since this is
the record kept by cities.  Actual age of the trees may be several
years more.  Diameter (cm) of the trees is measured at breast height (1.37m
above ground).

In the UTD, trees are classified taxonomically down to cultivar for some
individuals, but here we aggregate cultivars up to the species level.
Species are then nested within Genera.

The 17 cities in the UTD cover much of the US geographically, [[fig:utd_climate]], and
much of the variation in climate, [[fig:utd_gdd_precip_space_map]].
However, New York City only has a few observations and the data for
Indianapolis is missing too.

#+name: fig:utd_gdd_precip_space_map
#+caption: US census tract centroids with UTD reference cities overlaid in growing degree day (GDD) and precipitation climate space and matching color gradient in geographic space.  The reference cities cover climate space well, and variation in precipitation and growing degree days is continuous.
[[file:../figs/climate_space_wMap_labels.png]]

Rather than using the aggregated sunset zones as done in UTD, we used
growing degree days (GDD) and precipitation data from climate NOAA's
climate normals to continuously vary equation parameters across
climate.  Figure [[fig:utd_gdd_precip_space_map]] shows each
census tract centroid in the conterminous US plotted in GDD and precipitation
space.  We appoximated the GDD and precipitation for each tract by
assigning the values of the weather station closest to the centroid.
This allows us to vary our model continouously across geographic space
in a way that better captures the natural gradients of climate.

**** explanation of variables from [[https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/products/RDS-2016-0005/_metadata_RDS-2016-0005.html][metadata]]

DbaseID = Unique id number for each tree.

Region = 16 U.S. climate regions, abbreviations are used (see \Data\TS1_Regional_information.csv).

City = City/state names where data collected.

Source = Original *.xls filename (not available in this data publication).

TreeID = Number assigned to each tree in inventory by city.

Zone = Number/ID/name of the management area or zone that the tree is located in within a city; or nursery if young tree data collected there.

Park/Street = Data listed as Park, Street, Regional Big Tree, or Nursery (for young tree measurements).

SpCode = 4 to 6 letter code consisting of the first two letters of the genus name and the first two letters of the species name followed by two optional letters to distinguish two species with the same four-letter code (See \Data\TS2_Regional_species_and_counts.csv for a list of the SpCodes and corresponding scientific names.)

ScientificName = Botanical name of species.

CommonName = Common name of species.

Tree Type = 3 letter code where first two letters refer to life form (BD=broadleaf deciduous, BE=broadleaf evergreen, CE=coniferous evergreen, PE=palm evergreen) and the third letter is mature height (S=small which is < 8 meters, M=medium which is 8-15 meters, and L=large which is > 15 meters).

Address = From inventory, street number of building where tree is located.

Street = From inventory, the name of the street the tree is located on. (NOTE: zero values denote data were not recorded in that city. These values were left unchanged because they originated from city inventories.)

Side = From inventory, side of building or lot tree is located on (F=front, M=median, S=side, P=park). (NOTE: zero values denote data were not recorded in that city. These values were left unchanged because they originated from city inventories.)

Cell = From inventory, the cell number (i.e., 1, 2, 3, …), where protocol determines the order trees at same address are numbered (e.g., driving direction or as street number increases).

OnStreet = From inventory (omitted if not a field in city’s inventory), for trees at corner addresses when tree is on cross street rather than addressed street.

FromStreet = From inventory, the name of the first cross street that forms a boundary for trees lining un-addressed boulevards. Trees are typically numbered in order (1, 2, 3 …) on boulevards that have no development adjacent to them, no obvious parcel addresses.

ToStreet = From inventory, the name of the last cross street that forms a boundary for trees lining un-addressed boulevards.

Age = Number of years since planted. (NOTE: zero values represent newly planted trees, < 1 year old.)

DBH (cm) = Diameter at breast height (1.37 meters [m]) measured to nearest 0.1 centimeters (tape). For multi-stemmed trees forking below 1.37 m measured above the butt flare and below the point where the stem begins forking, as per protocol.

TreeHt (m) = From ground level to tree top to nearest 0.5 m (omitting erratic leader).

CrnBase (m) = Average distance between ground and lowest foliage layer to nearest 0.5 m (omitting erratic branch).

CrnHt (m) = Calculated as TreeHT minus Crnbase to nearest 0.5 m. (NOTE: zero values indicate no live crown was present, hence no other tree dimension data were available.)

CdiaPar (m) = Crown diameter measurement taken to the nearest 0.5 m parallel to the street (omitting erratic branch).

CDiaPerp (m) = Crown diameter measurement taken to the nearest 0.5 m perpendicular to the street (omitting erratic branch).

AvgCdia (m) = The average of crown diameter measured parallel and perpendicular to the street.

Leaf (m2) = Estimated using digital imaging method to nearest 0.1 squared meter (m2).

Setback = Distance from tree to nearest air-conditioned/heated space (may not be same address as tree location): 1=0-8 m, 2=8.1-12 m, 3=12.1-18 m, 4=> 18 m.

TreeOr = Taken with compass, the coordinate of tree taken from imaginary lines extending from walls of the nearest conditioned space (may not be same address as tree location).

CarShade = Number of parked automotive vehicles with some part under the tree's drip line. Car must be present (0=no autos, 1=1 auto, etc.).

LandUse = Predominant land use type where tree is growing (1=single family residential, 2=multi-family residential [duplex, apartments, condos], 3=industrial/institutional/large commercial [schools, gov't, hospitals], 4=park/vacant/other [agric., unmanaged riparian areas of greenbelts], 5=small commercial [minimart, retail boutiques, etc.], 6=transportation corridor).

Shape = Visual estimate of crown shape verified from each side with actual measured dimensions of crown height and average crown diameter (1=cylinder [maintains same crown diameter in top and bottom thirds of tree], 2=ellipsoid, the tree's center [whether vertical or horizontal is the widest, includes spherical], 3=paraboloid [widest in bottom third of crown], 4=upside down paraboloid [widest in top third of crown]).

WireConf = Utility lines that interfere with or appear above tree (0=no lines, 1=present and no potential conflict, 2=present and conflicting, 3=present and potential for conflicting). (NOTE: -1 denotes data were not collected.)

dbh1 = Dbh (centimeters [cm]) for multi-stemmed trees; for non-multi-stemmed trees, dbh1 is same as Dbh (cm).

dbh2 = Dbh (cm) for second stem of multi-stemmed trees.

dbh3 = Dbh (cm) for third stem of multi-stemmed trees.

dbh4 = Dbh (cm) for fourth stem of multi-stemmed trees.

dbh5 = Dbh (cm) for fifth stem of multi-stemmed trees.

dbh6 = Dbh (cm) for sixth stem of multi-stemmed trees.

dbh7 = Dbh (cm) for seventh stem of multi-stemmed trees.

dbh8 = Dbh (cm) for eight stem of multi-stemmed trees.

The ironic thing about this figure is that Fort Collins is the
"North".  This includes a great variety of areas including Cheyenne,
WY, which according to figure 5 (McPherson and Peper 2012) in the same
document have greeen ash trees that have 55% of the leaf area of Fort
Collins green ash at age 60.  This incredible variability within
regions, hence the need for more continuous approach.  Fort Collins
equations are meant to apply to the northern parts of
maine...definitley space for improvement here (though very few live
there so maybe doesn't matter so much).  Notice how
often the reference city is on the border of the climate zone.

Get a figure showing the climate of census tracts.  Basically remake
the above figure to be more continuous

Make a figure showing the reference cities in GDD and Precip space to
reveal where there are significant holes that could be filled.  What
future cities to sample.

When I make the marginal effects plot of GDD versus Precip, I should
make the plot cover the values seen in the US.

We also have unequal observations across cities.  NY has very few.

*** COMMENT Get new climate data.  Growing degree days and Precip. Make plots

Plot, census tracts in GDD and Precip Space.  An inset of the US
continental with the color scheme.

overlay the reference cities on this plot

units of precip are 100ths of inches

Also along the top I could have a N cities row, and along the right I
could have a N species column.  But that's a lot of work for what is
readily apparent when looking.

I should order left to right by n cities that a species is observed in
and then by city (alphabetic)

** Modelling
*** Model requirements
We sought a model of tree growth that would adequately represent the
known biological dynamics of tree growth, namely that diameter growth
rate starts slow, reaches a maximum at a young age, and then gradually
declines to nearly zero.  Diameter for trees much always increase
however slightly because the growth of new wood is essential for
proper function.  This is different than tree height which often
reaches its asympotote.  Instead the asympote in our curve could be
considered a pragmatic way to constrain diameter growth, or a
practical asympote.  While trees could theoretically continue to
increase in diameter indefinitely, they don't in reality.  The
asympote represents this practical maximum diameter.  An additional
feature to the data is that age is time since transplanting.  This
means trees can have substantial diameter at age 0.

The type of curve that meets these criteria would be an asymmetric
sigmoidal curve with an intercept.  A modified weibull is such a curve
that has worked well in forestry and is the one we use here
cite:weiskittel_e_2011.  However, there are many
other curves that meet these criteria and could be used.

Another characteristic of tree growth curves is heterosckedasticity,
namely that as the age of a tree increases, so does the variability
around the mean.  Often past modellers controlled this using log - log
transformations cite:troxel_e_2013, but we wanted to keep units in
their original scale.  We tested fitting models where the variance was
a linear function or a smoothed spline function of age.  However, this
still could yield negative predictions at low ages.  Instead we
adopted the approach of modeling DBH from a gamma distribution, which yielded
more realistic posterior predictions.

We fit models of generally increasing complexity starting a single
weibull curve for all trees and then varying the curve parameters by
city, by genus and species, and by climate.  Using approximate
leave-one-out cross validation we selected the model with the highest
estimated log posterior density cite:vehtari_e_2017.  The following
section details this model, and other models tested are in
supplementary materials.

*** Model
**** likelihood
\[
y_{igsc} \sim Gamma(\mu_{igsc}, \alpha_y)
\]

\[
\mu_{igsc} = \beta^{0}_{igsc} + \beta^1_{igsc} (1 - \exp(-\beta^{2}_{igsc} x_{igsc}^{\beta^3_{igsc}}))
\]

where:

/y_{igsc}/ is the diameter at breast height of tree /i/ of genus, /g/,
species, /s/, and city, /c/. /y_{igsc}/ has a gamma distribution with
mean, \mu_{igsc}, and shape, /\alpha_y/.

/i/ = 1, ...., /n_{sc}/; where /n_{sc}/ is the number of trees sampled for
species, /s/, and city, /c/.

/g/ = 1, ..., /G/; where /G/ is the number of genera (G)

/s/ = 1, ..., /S_g/; where /S_g/ is the number of species in genus
/g/.

/x_{igsc}/ is the transplant age in years of tree /igsc/ (i.e. years
since transplanting).

$\beta^0_{igsc}$ is the intercept, or the diameter of a tree at time
of transplanting.

$\beta^1_{igsc}$ (plus $\beta^0_{igsc}$) is the asymptote of the
sigmoidal weibull curve.

$\beta^2_{igsc}$ and $\beta^3_{igsc}$ affect the rate of growth.  $\beta^2_{igsc}$ provides flexibility to have
slow or fast growth at young ages.

For each $\beta^j_{igsc}$, /j/ = 0,1,2:

\[
\beta^j_{igsc} = \beta^j_0 + \gamma^j_{gs}+\delta^j_{c}
\]

for $\beta^3_{igsc}$:
\[
\beta^3_{igsc} = \beta^3_0 + \tau_1 * \text{precip}_c + \tau_2 * \text{gdd}_c + \tau_3 *
(\text{precip}_c * \text{gdd}_c) + \gamma^3_{gs}+\delta^3_{c}
\]

where $\beta^j_0$ is the mean for $\beta^j_{igsc}$. $\gamma^j_{gs}$ is
genetic (genus and species) effect on $\beta^j$.  $\delta^j_{c}$ is the
city effect on $\beta^j$

The species effect is nested within the genus effect.  Both are
normally distributed, such that:
\[
\gamma^j_{gs} \sim N(\gamma^j_{g}, \sigma^j_{genus:species})
\]

\[
\gamma^j_{g} \sim N(0, \sigma^j_{genus})
\]

The effect of city is normally distributed:
\[
\delta^j_{c} \sim N(0, \sigma^j_{city})
\]


**** Priors

The priors were selected to make biologically unrealistic parameters
highly improbable, but they have a small effect on the posterior
estimates.  The \beta's and \alpha_y are gamma distributed, while the
variance parameters are half-normal.  More details on the selection of
priors are available in supplementary materials and code.  Many priors
that might appear to be narrow (e.g Half-Normal(0,.1)) are actually
fairly wide given the scale of the predictors and the reasonable range
of some parameters.

**** COMMENT Prior stuff for appendix
Priors were selected to be slightly informative and make very
biologically unreasonable parameters improbable.  The quanitity of
data overwhelms the priors, but the relatively narrow priors also
helps with sampling.


All \beta's must be positive and they are likely correlated with one
another, especially /\beta^1_{igsc}/ and /\beta^3_{igsc}/.  Without very old trees that are close
to their asympototic dbh, it is harder to separate these two parameters.

these priors selected because they create a wide range of possible
mean curves, but they are physically possible.

variability by cities and species, something realistic for each parameter

all sigmas: for beta_0, the intercept.  realistic values for this
range from 1 to maybe 10 (that would be a very large average size to
plant).  Therefore, the sd for \delta, \sigma_{0 c[i]}, is likely less
than 1.5.  I'll set the prior so that there's a 95% chance it's less
than 1.5.  Variation between genus/species, the sd for \gamma, is
probably similar.

((10 - 1) / 2) / 3 = 1.5.  (take the range of possible values, assume it is ~99.7%
range of normal, find the sd by cutting in half and dividing by 3).
This is the highest sd I would expect.  Set the prior so that I'm
saying I think there is a 99.7% chance I think the the sd is less than
this.  So I make the sd on the prior, 1/3 the highest sd I think is possible.

species is quarter of genus

\[
\sigma_{0_g[i]} \sim \text{Normal}(0, .4)
\]

\[
\sigma_{0_s[i]} \sim \text{Normal}(0, .1)
\]

\[
\sigma_{0_c[i]} \sim \text{Normal}(0, .3)
\]


When fit in stan, \beta_1 is multiplied by 100, so that it is on a
similar order of magnitude as the other parameters (around 1) and the
interpretation is the asymptotic diameter in meters (rather than centimeters).
Possible values for \beta_1 might range from .5 to 3 between different
genera.  Differences between species within genera will likely be less.
I expect there to be less difference between cities in the
average asymptote.

((3 - .5) / 2) / 3 = .4167 (I'll set genus to slightly less than this
because there is also species variation, which I'll set to .1 since I
expect most the time species within the same genus to be quite
similar, probably within about 1m of one another).  I'll set city
variation to the same as species.

.4 / 3 = .133
.2 / 3 = .067

for beta_1
\[
\sigma_{1_g[i]} \sim half-Normal(0.1, .4)
\]

\[
\sigma_{1_s[i]} \sim half-Normal(0, .1)
\]

for \beta_2 and \beta_3
I don't have as good of intuition for \beta_2 or \beta_3, but from
looking at curves created with different values, I expect their
variation to be smaller than for \beta_0 and \beta_1.  For a start
I'll set the variation to about half of what I set it for \beta_1.

\[
\sigma_{2_g[i]} \sim half-Normal(0, .1)
\]

\[
\sigma_{2_s[i]} \sim half-Normal(0, .05)
\]

\[
\sigma_{2_c[i]} \sim half-Normal(0, .1)
\]

\[
\sigma_{3_g[i]} \sim half-Normal(0, .1)
\]

\[
\sigma_{3_s[i]} \sim half-Normal(0, .05)
\]

\[
\sigma_{3_c[i]} \sim half-Normal(0, .1)
\]



The coefficients for climate variables on \beta_1
gdd are in thosands.  range in data is about 6000 gdd, or 6 thousands
gdd.  I expect the effects of gdd, precip, and their interaction to be
positive.  I expect the increase in asympote across this range to be
not too big, maybe as little as .1m and as much as 1m.  So the
coeffcient might be 0.0167 to 0.167.  The interaction term will also
be positive, but smaller.

precip
\[
\tau_1 \sim Normal(.01, .01)
\]

gdd
\[
\tau_2 \sim Normal(.01, .015)
\]

gdd:precip
\[
\tau_3 \sim Normal(.005, .005)
\]





*** COMMENT Modeling Notes
**** COMMENT What should the structure of the equations be?

DBH ~ age

assymetrical

***** Height
from cite:Weiskittel_ForestGrowthAndYieldModeling:
For example, a cumulative growth curve of height over age shows three
primary stages: (1) juvenile period where growth is rapid and often
exponential; (2) a long period of maturation where the trend is nearly
linear; and (3) old age, where growth is nearly asymptotic

height ~ dbh - weibull? see pg 116 cite:Weiskittel_ForestGrowthAndYieldModeling

Constraining the model with very low dbh's
In addition to asymptotic behavior, most height-to-diameter equation
forms are also constrained to predict a height of 1.3 or 1.37
(i.e. breast height) when DBH is equal to zero, but this constraint
may cause poorer model performance across the full range of DBH
(Newton and Amponsah, 2007).

Hardwood heights tend to be harder to predict because of the lack of a
true leader and the difficulty of measuring hardwood heights
accurately (e.g. Kitahara et al., 2010).


Why Weibull is a decent option:  pg116 cite:Weiskittel_ForestGrowthAndYieldModeling
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Significant differences between model forms can exist, however, when
limited data are available. For example, Temesgen and von Gadow (2004)
found that the percentage difference in root mean square error between
the best and worst equation for five commonly used model forms varied
from 5 to 33%. Huang et al. (1992) found in their analysis that the
Chapman–Richards, Weibull, and a modified logistic-type function were
consistently among the best performing models because they were
flexible, able to assume a variety of shapes, and extrapolated well.
#+END_QUOTE

***** DBH
cite:Weiskittel_ForestGrowthAndYieldModeling
A diameter growth curve would show much the same trend, except there
is a tendency toward more sustained growth rate as the tree matures
(Hann and Hanus, 2002b). While height increment may nearly cease in
maturity, diameter increment must continue in order to produce the
xylem and phloem needed for tree survival
***** sigmoidal forms, see the citations within:
cite:Weiskittel_ForestGrowthAndYieldModeling
Various theoretical sigmoid model forms are used to predict growth in
forestry (Zeide, 1993), but most of them can be generalized with a
single equation form (Garcıa, 2005c). The most common sigmoid model
forms include the Gompertz (1825), Bertalanffy (1949), and Richards
(1959) equations.

Although these theoretical models offer some biological
interpretability (e.g. Zeide, 2004), it is easily shown that
well-formulated empirical sigmoid equations can be just as accurate or
even more accurate for a wide range of data (e.g. Martin and Ek, 1984)

the higher values of b2 only make sense with lower values of b3.  they
are correlated.  I wonder if I could include that information in the prior?

**** COMMENT bits

WRITE OUT THE MODEL.....
then convert to latex.

Use brm(..., sample_prior = "only")

- Goal is to model tree dimensions as a function of age (and other factors).
  - I'm not doing allometric models (relating dimensions to one
    another) because
    - they are usually log-log, simpler and less interesting
    - But doing them would be a natural extension
- from simple to complex
  - single species, single location, homoskedasticity
  - single species, single location, heteroskedasticity
  - multiple species, single location, heteroskedasticity
  - multiple species, vary by climate, heteroskedasticity

- for each of these approaches follow the workflow:
  - problem
  - model
  - fake data
  - fit
  - diagnostics
  - graph fit
  - PPCs (Posterior Predictive Check)
  - Compare models
- criteria for model form
  - Theoretically realistic
    - follow what we know about biology
    - increase confidence in extrapolation
    - assymetrical sigmoidal for growth
  - Interpretable and parsimonious
    - few parameters that correspond as much as possible to an
      interpretable part of growth
  - Can fit in Stan
- think hard about smart priors to help with convergence.
  - I need to address the initial value errors.

y = diameter at breast height (cm)

and the response variable.

** Model Comparisons

Short descriptions of the models tested and the brms sytax are in
table [[tab:model_descriptions]]


Note, I removed the scaling of the parameters (multiplying and
dividing by 100) in the formula for clarity.  In the code they are
scaled so that the parameters are on the same order of magnitude and
HMC sampling is improved.

** COMMENT ideas
summary figure showing parameter marginal posterior distributions.  Or
maybe just mean and a couple confidence intervals

figure showing the age versus dbh for several species and city
combinations.  overlay our models and the existing models for
comparison.

figure showing the marginal effects smooth plot of gdd versus precip,
with a contour showing in what climate space 50%, 75%, and 95% of the
US population lives.
The marginal effects and the uncertainty in them could also be mapped back into geographic space
and the map could show that.  That would be neat.


comparison to old method

show predicitive intervals for
- known genus/species in known city,
- known genus, unknown species in known city
- unknown genus, unknown species in unknown city
-

An extension on this.  Rather than showing the predictive intervals, I
could make draws for random species, genus, city from the posterior
and plot the estimates.  Imagine sampling 30 new genera, 4 species for
each genera, and a couple cities.  Then making spaghetti plot of these.

Show how the equations vary continuously across geographic space,
show the equations for a variety of unsampled cities.

* Discussoins

interpreting parameter estimates:
For most species there are no data near the
true asymptote and so this parameter should be considered a highly
uncertain estimate of the real maximum dbh of a tree.  Pragmatically,
it models/causes the slowing of the diameter growth of a tree as it
ages.

An early version of the UTD equations didn't have as much data, but
their approach modified parameters based on the number of frost free
days cite:frelich_1992

cite:peper_2001a - tested modified weibull following
cite:frelich_1992, but went with logarithm regression model because it
had the best in-sample fit.  We think weibull would have
the best out of sample fit.



cite:peper_2001a noted that differences in the dimensions of sweetgum
and camphor in Modesto and in Santa Monica were due to different
pruning regimes, cultural practices.  This shows the challenges in
modelling.  There are some difficult to capture human cultural
elements.


several trees
- what is the distribution of maximum age by species?  many have very
  young
- or the distribution of apps max?
- We need to be able to predict to older ages if we want to make
  realistic predictions.

make better
- more data, duh, perhaps used results to identify where to sample
- more cities, this is important for interpolation across climate
  space. Could allow for nonlinear relationships and for more variables.
- better climate predictors
- interactions between climate and species.
- use phylogenetic distance, gaussian process, instead of multiple
  levels of taxonomy.
- an easy one is to nest genus with tree functional type (broad leaf
  deciduous, evergreen conifer, etc.)
- extend species with species level predictors (leaf morphology, wood
  characteristics, shade tolerance, etc).
- smarter priors (e.g. max dbh based on champion trees?)  is this
  possible?  I think it would be a very neat extension, but need to
  think about how these champions are not urban trees most the time.
  They provide the upper limit on the asymptote, but for urban trees
  the asymptote could be quite lower.
- incorporate uncertainty in AGE
- There were only 4 trees in Queens NY sampled.
- repeat measures on the same individuals would help much.
- Get more trees in the database, UFIA effort?
- add varying intercept for location of tree in
  sidewalk/underpowerlines etc.
- There are some funny things with minneapolis data.  is it from the
  same individual for each species?
- challenges of separating \beta_1 and \beta_3 without old trees.
