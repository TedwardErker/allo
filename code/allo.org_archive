test different functions:
1) linear; y = a + bx
2) quadratic; y = a + bx + cx^2
3) log-log; log(y) = log(a + bx)

Allow none, some, or all of the parameters of these functions to vary
by species and with climate.  Use AIC to select the best model.

Palms are so different, it doesn't make much sense to pool them with
the other species.

model form:
cite:Weiskittel_ForestGrowthAndYieldModeling:
"This reality should lead to model forms that are complex enough to
accurately and adequately characterize the expected major behaviors of
the population, but simple enough to avoid being overly influenced by
the sampleâ€™s peculiarities."

see notes on bayesian approach in cite:Weiskittel_ForestGrowthAndYieldModeling

** priors

think about looking at champion tree datasets to get maximum sizes.

** COMMENT monotonic quadratic
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/197509/how-to-smooth-data-and-force-monotonicity

I wonder if I could find a way to do this for a multilevel model.
biometry project implementing this monotonic constraint in stan?
