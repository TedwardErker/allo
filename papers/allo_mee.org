I'm thinking of splitting it into two parts/papers. 
p
The first would be methodological - rewriting for a more general
audience interested in how to fit bayesian multilevel growth models in
ecology via brms and Stan.  I'm thinking the journal Methods in
Ecology and Evolution might be fitting.  They have previously
published a paper highlighting Stan and others about plant growth
models.  I think my work would be in the same vein as these and a good
addition.


The second would be applied and focused on urban forestry.  Talking to
people at the forest service there is more data that I should
incorporate into the model to make it actually useful to this
audience.  But I also think it would involve significant additional
work (many of the things I mentioned as next steps) and warrant a new
paper.  For this I was thinking of targeting the journal Forest
Ecology and Management or Urban Forestry and Urban Greening.
* submission requirements
https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/2041210X/author-guidelines

Single column, double line spaced
Within the word count (6000-7000 words for Standard Articles, 3000 words for Applications)
Continuous line and page numbering throughout
Clearly defined manuscript structure as standard: Author details, Abstract (must be numbered according to Manuscript Specifications), Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Figures and Tables with captions
Figures and Tables can be embedded within the text where referenced to facilitate reviewing
Statement of where you intend to archive your data

Research article:  should have a maximum of 6000-7000 words (including
tables/figure captions and references) and describe new methods and
how they may be used.  We place emphasis on methods that are
applicable as broadly as possible. Papers describing methods that
apply to one species or system are unlikely to meet these criteria,
unless authors are able to show that their methods can be
generalised. Structure: see Manuscript specifications below.

Manuscripts should be formatted with double-spaced lines and
continuous line numbers throughout the article, including pages for
acknowledgements, references, tables and figures. Manuscripts must be
written in English. Authors for whom English is not their first
language may wish to consider using a professional editing service
before submission, e.g. Wiley’s editing services. The use of these
services does not guarantee acceptance or preference for
publication. It is also recommended that authors follow search engine
optimisations guidelines to maximise the reach of their article.




Submissions should be divided into the following sections:

Title Page should include:

A concise and informative title. Do not include the authorities for taxonomic names.
A list of all authors' names with names and addresses of Institutions.
The name, address and e-mail address of the correspondence author.
A running headline of not more than 45 characters.
Abstract

The Abstract must not exceed 350 words and should list the main results and conclusions, using simple, factual, numbered statements:

Point 1: set the context for and purpose of the work;

Point 2: indicate the approach and methods;

Point 3: outline the main results;

Point 4: identify the conclusions and the wider implications.



Key-words: A list in alphabetical order not exceeding eight words or
short phrases. The most important key-words should appear in the title
and the abstract as well as the key-word list. More advice on
selecting good keywords can be found here.


Introduction

This should state the reason for doing the work, the nature of the
hypothesis or hypotheses under consideration, and should outline the
essential background.


Materials and Methods

Include sufficient details for the work to be repeated. Where specific
equipment and materials are named, the manufacturer’s details (name,
city and country) should be given so that readers can trace
specifications by contacting the manufacturer. Where commercially
available software has been used, details of the supplier should be
given in brackets or the reference given in full in the reference
list. Do not describe or refer to commonplace statistical tests in
this section but allude to them briefly in Results.


Results

State the results and draw attention in the text to important details shown in tables and figures.

Discussion

This should point out the significance of the results in relation to
the reasons for doing the work, and place them in the context of other
work.

Conclusions (optional)

Acknowledgements (optional)

A brief statement acknowledging collaborators and research assistants
who do not meet the criteria for authorship described above, or
acknowledging funding sources, providing relevant permit numbers
(including institutional animal use permits), or giving recognition to
nature reserves or other organizations that made the work possible.



* Questions for Jun

Why model the correlation between groups / covariance structure?  What does that add?
Does it affect prediction?  pg 157 touches on this a bit

How to deal with the normal response. since I use a gamma.  even log
transform won't make it exactly comparable

* Improvements before submission. / new notes
Comparison to lmer
 - attempt to fit in nlme
 - if not possible to fit, simulate data from the proposed model and
   then fit in both lmer and with brms/stan

plot random effects of coefficients by species kinda like this:

nlme uses maximum likelihood (not restricted maximum likelihood) so
that likelihood ratio tests can be done.

check the confidence intervals for the correlation of random effects.
Make sure the intervals are not huge (-1 to 1) which would indicate
the matrix is ill-conditioned.  pg 364 has good text on testing which
rfs to include.
