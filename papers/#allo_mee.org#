Rewrite to be more general growth model.

fitting fixed and random effects in them, as these topics are
elegantly presented elsewhere (Pinheiro & Bates 2000; Bolker 2008;
Ritz & Streibig 2008; Bolker et al. 2009)

I'm thinking of splitting it into two parts/papers. 
p
The first would be methodological - rewriting for a more general
audience interested in how to fit bayesian multilevel growth models in
ecology via brms and Stan.  I'm thinking the journal Methods in
Ecology and Evolution might be fitting.  They have previously
published a paper highlighting Stan and others about plant growth
models.  I think my work would be in the same vein as these and a good
addition.


The second would be applied and focused on urban forestry.  Talking to
people at the forest service there is more data that I should
incorporate into the model to make it actually useful to this
audience.  But I also think it would involve significant additional
work (many of the things I mentioned as next steps) and warrant a new
paper.  For this I was thinking of targeting the journal Forest
Ecology and Management or Urban Forestry and Urban Greening.
* submission requirements
Single column, double line spaced
Within the word count (6000-7000 words for Standard Articles, 3000 words for Applications)
Continuous line and page numbering throughout
Clearly defined manuscript structure as standard: Author details, Abstract (must be numbered according to Manuscript Specifications), Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Figures and Tables with captions
Figures and Tables can be embedded within the text where referenced to facilitate reviewing
Statement of where you intend to archive your data

* Questions for Jun

Why model the correlation between groups / covariance structure?  What does that add?
Does it affect prediction?  pg 157 touches on this a bit

How to deal with the normal response. since I use a gamma.  even log
transform won't make it exactly comparable

* Improvements before submission. / new notes
Comparison to lmer
 - attempt to fit in nlme
 - if not possible to fit, simulate data from the proposed model and
   then fit in both lmer and with brms/stan

plot random effects of coefficients by species kinda like this:

nlme uses maximum likelihood (not restricted maximum likelihood) so
that likelihood ratio tests can be done.

check the confidence intervals for the correlation of random effects.
Make sure the intervals are not huge (-1 to 1) which would indicate
the matrix is ill-conditioned.  pg 364 has good text on testing which
rfs to include.
